# Cafe Pomodoro
This is a simple Pomodoro timer app built with React + Typescript.

## Motivation
I built this app to practice my React and Typescript skills.

I also wanted a simple Pomodoro timer where I can also listen to cafe sounds to help with my productivity.

This is v2 of the [Pomodoro app I originally built to learn Javascript many moons ago](https://github.com/alexhippo/pomodoro).

## Technologies used
- React 18
- TypeScript 5
