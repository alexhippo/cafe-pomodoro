# Cafe Pomodoro

This is a simple Pomodoro timer app built with React + Typescript.

## Motivation

I built this app to practice my React and Typescript skills.

I also wanted a simple Pomodoro timer where I can also listen to cafe sounds to help with my productivity.

In addition, I tried to make the timer more accessible by updating a status message every minute for users of assistive technology. This was based off [an ARIA Countdown pattern made by Paul J Adam](https://pauljadam.com/demos/ariacountdown.html).

This is v2 of the [Pomodoro app I originally built to learn how to code](https://github.com/alexhippo/pomodoro).

## Technologies used

- React 18
- TypeScript 5
